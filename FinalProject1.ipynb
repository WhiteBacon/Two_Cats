    "Colorado has recovered from the worst recession – a steep downturn spanning 2007 to 2009 – since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Unemployment surpassed 10 percent nationwide at the peak, with joblessness running higher in some states. Since then, unemployment has fallen below 5 percent nationally, though the recovery hasn’t been consistent nationwide. The growth of the nation's gross domestic product, 3.2 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2019, was above that of the previous period.\n",

    "Entrepreneurs, free-lancers and business owners are currently looking to see what to do next, as the rules change every day. Consider Monterrey, in Mexico; the government stated that all business operations should be from 9am to 8pm Monday through Saturday, and completely closed on Sundays. In Poland, all non-essential companies have to remain closed until new notice, and so on that every state in every country is taking different measures to deal with this...so the business category is relevant when deciding what your future income is going to be.
